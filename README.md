The app is built using React and styled using Bootstrap along with it's icons!

The project contains all the functionality:

-   A dashboard filled with all the items present in the store, we're currently getting static data, but we can get it via API,
-   Opening a modal when add to cart is clicked & also adding it into your cart,
-   Open the description of the product when clicked in image,
-   A cart page to check items you've added,
-   Increment, Decrement number of items in the cart,
-   Remove an item from cart,
-   Delete content of the entire cart,
-   Checkout and pay using PayPal Sandbox (currently disabled because it's not supporting in mobile) using `npm install --save react-paypal-express-checkout`,
-   And finally depolying it into server using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> The project is hosted in site [Mobile Store(https://shaswatkr-mobilestore.netlify.app)](https://shaswatkr-mobilestore.netlify.app).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
